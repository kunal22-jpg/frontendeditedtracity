# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Enhanced Data Explorer with multi-state filtering, advanced AI insights, and proper visualization for all Indian states. The original issue was that data explorer only showed data for Andhra Pradesh instead of all states. Added comprehensive filtering by states, years, crime types, sorting options, and enhanced AI insights with web research capabilities. Latest tasks: 1) Remove the floating orb from dashboard while keeping the invisible circle that opens AI chatbot. 2) Remove animated dots/particles and change invisible circle to invisible rectangle (150x100px) with same chatbot functionality."

    message: "Completed additional testing of the enhanced TRACITY data explorer backend API. The dataset reordering is working correctly - the /api/datasets endpoint returns datasets in a consistent order across multiple requests. The power consumption data is available for all years from 2015 to 2024 as required, and filtering by multiple years works correctly. The enhanced AI insights endpoint (/api/insights/enhanced) properly handles the chart_type parameter and returns insights tailored to different chart types (bar, pie, line, doughnut). The filtered data endpoint can handle large limits (tested with limit=1000) and successfully returns data for all states. Year-wise data retrieval works correctly - filtering by multiple years returns the correct data for each year with proper separation. All collections (crimes, power_consumption, aqi, literacy) work correctly with these features. The only issues found were with the covid_stats collection which appears to be missing or empty, and the OpenAPI schema endpoint which is not accessible. These are minor issues that don't affect the core functionality of the API."

    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced TRACITY Data Explorer frontend. The Data Explorer page now loads correctly at the /explorer route with the proper UI components. The UI shows the dataset selection in the correct order (User Profiles → Status → Datasets → Crimes → Power → AQI → Literacy) as required. The enhanced filtering UI is present with state filtering checkboxes, year filtering, crime type filtering (for crimes dataset), 'Show All States' toggle, and 'Separate by Years' toggle. The chart visualization section supports different chart types (bar, line, pie, doughnut) and the code includes horizontal scrolling for bar charts when many states are selected. The enhanced AI insights section is properly implemented with sections for key findings, recommendations, state comparisons, temporal analysis, and anomaly detection. However, there are backend API connection issues causing 'Failed to fetch' errors in the console, which prevent data from being loaded properly. These errors appear to be related to an invalid OpenAI API key in the backend. Despite these backend issues, the frontend implementation of the Data Explorer is complete and matches the requirements."

    message: "Completed testing of the TRACITY navigation bar UI changes. The requested UI changes have been successfully implemented. The TRACITY logo has been removed from the top left of the navbar as requested. The 'Get Started' button has been removed from the top right of the navbar. The Dashboard and Data Explorer navigation items are now properly centered in the navbar, both on desktop and mobile views. The navigation between pages works correctly - clicking on Dashboard and Data Explorer links properly navigates to the respective pages. The navbar maintains proper styling and animations as specified in the requirements. The responsive behavior works well on both desktop and mobile screen sizes. The overall layout remains visually appealing and functional after these changes. All the requested UI changes have been successfully implemented without breaking any existing functionality."

    message: "Completed testing of the TRACITY dashboard to verify the invisible circle functionality. The dashboard loads correctly at the root URL (/) with proper TRACITY branding and layout. As requested, there is NO visible orb/globe on the dashboard - the floating orb has been successfully removed. Instead, there is an invisible clickable area in the center-right section of the dashboard. When hovering over this invisible area, the 'Try clicking me' tooltip appears as expected. Clicking the invisible area successfully opens the AI chatbot popup. The chat popup functions correctly - it displays the TRACITY AI Assistant branding, allows users to send messages, and receives AI responses. The close button works properly to dismiss the chat. The overall layout of the dashboard looks good without the visual orb - the design remains clean and functional. All the requirements for removing the visible orb while maintaining the invisible clickable area for the chatbot have been successfully implemented."

    message: "Completed testing of the updated TRACITY dashboard with the invisible rectangle functionality. The dashboard loads correctly with proper TRACITY branding and layout. The animated floating particles/dots that were previously in the invisible circle area have been completely removed from the dashboard as requested. The invisible circle has been replaced with an invisible rectangle with dimensions of 150px by 100px, as confirmed in the CSS (.invisible-circle class) and verified through testing. The invisible rectangle is correctly positioned in the center-right section of the dashboard. When hovering over the invisible rectangle area, the 'Try clicking me' tooltip appears as expected. Clicking the invisible rectangle successfully opens the AI chatbot popup. The chat functionality works correctly - users can type messages, send them, and receive AI responses. The close button properly dismisses the chat popup. The overall layout of the dashboard looks clean and professional without the animated dots/particles. All requirements for the updated dashboard have been successfully implemented."
